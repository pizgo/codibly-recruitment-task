# Pantone color of the year

The purpose of the app is to present Pantone colors of the year. After being fetched from the API the data is present in a table, 5 items per page. The user can navigate between items with pagination buttons and filter the searched item by ID. The pagination and filtered ID are reflected in the URL, so it's possible for users to share links with specific search result. After cliking on a row with specific color, the modal pops up with detailed information about the item.
