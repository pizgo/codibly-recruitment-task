# Pantone color of the year

## What it does:
* presents data about pantone color of the year fetched from the API
* user can navigate between items with pagination buttons and serach for the specific item by ID
* the pagination and filtered ID are reflected in the URL, so it's possible for users to share links with specific search result 
* after cliking on a row with specific color, the modal pops up with detailed information about the item.

## Why I made this 
* because I like colors :)
* to practice TypeScript, custom hooks and working with URLSearchParams;
* to get familiar with Material UI 

## Technologies:
* Typescript
* React.js
* react-router-dom
* custom hooks
* MUI

## Future improvements:
* migrating state to Redux
* adding tests
* adding funcionality for searching information about different colors
* adding color palette generator 
* improving the UI
